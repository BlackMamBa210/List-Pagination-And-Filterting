# List Pagination And Filterting
# Day 1:
* Today I started project 2 by creating variables to select the DOM elements from 64students.html. I targeted the '.page' and 'li' elements.
* I tested the results with `console.log` and no errors.
* After that I moved on to creating a function that will create the pages for the students. 
* After that I posted my day 1 progress on slack to see if I was on the right track.
	
# Day 2:
* I checked slack for any responses and got feedback on taking a closer look at my `showPage` function.
* A slack moderater suggested me to do some practice exercises that he kindly linked for me and after spending some time doing those practice exercises I was able to see my mistake and apply changes to my function.
* After the changes were made I checked the variable `console.log` and got a few token errors then fixed them.
* Once the variable was running without errors I moved onto writing my for loops. I didn't fully understand for loops in javascript so I googled it and did the javascript loops practice available in the Library. From there I got a better understanding of for loops and applied them to my project and ran the `console.log` to test the loop.
